The lists of numbers we used are first-order; lists of lists would be considered second-order, etc. If, for example, we had done RNA-seq to get gene expression of thousands of genes across our 10 samples, we could organize these into a second-order matrix and use `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` perform t-tests for each gene.
